# ShareList - Share your playlists with the world

ShareList is a platform for sharing spotify playlists. It leverages the Spotify Web API for authentication. ShareList is a PWA built in React, hence it is installable just like a native android application. Therefore, users can directly share from their Spotify account, rather copy pasting the playlist link.
